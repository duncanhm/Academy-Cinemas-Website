# Academy-Cinemas-Website
A mock website for a fictional local cinema I created using Bootstrap4.

A mock website I put together for a fictional local cinema. This was the first project I worked on while learing Bootstrap4. It is pretty basic and not dynamic, but I was able to get a great feel for some of the various modals and structure of a Bootstrap site. I have since gone on to use the knowledge I picked up on this project to help me with front-end design on the Blue Ribbons Review ASP.NET MVC application I worked with during my most recent internship.
